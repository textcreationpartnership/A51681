            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>By way of Reflection upon their Laſt Speeches.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Shall divide their <hi>Speeches</hi> into two Parts or Branches:
<list>
                  <item>1. Their flat Denial of thoſe Crimes and Matters laid to their Charge: <hi>viz. The Conſpiring of the Death of the King, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Government and the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Their Proteſtations againſt all manner of Pardons, Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, or Diſpenſations for Lying, Swearing, or Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt part, <hi>viz. The Denial of thoſe Crimes,</hi> &amp;c. I think it may be anſwered, and the reaſon given, without any manner of difficulty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it hath been their Doctrine and Practice in all Times to hold, The Depoſing of Princes, Murthering of them and their Subjects, and Diſpoſing of their Dominions, to be lawful; is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved by that Worthy Prelat the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> by numerous Examples out of their own Authors; and alſo ſee the <hi>Jeſuits Catechiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the King of <hi>England</hi> was actually depoſed, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions diſpoſed of (according to their real apprehenſions and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) hath been proved before the Parliament; where it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62432:2"/>was ſworn, <hi>That the Pope in the Congregation</hi> De Propaganda Fide, <hi>held about</hi> December 1677, <hi>declared His Majeſties Dominions St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>Patrimony, as forfeited to him for the Hereſie of Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſo to be diſpoſed of as he pleaſeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this end he appointed Cardinal <hi>Howard,</hi> as his Legate, to take Poſſeſſion of <hi>England</hi> in his Name.</p>
            <p>And that at a Conſult held in <hi>May</hi> 1678, by the Provincial and Society of Jeſuits, <hi>They declare the King an Heretick, they depoſe him and condemn him to be murdered:</hi> And at ſome other Conſults, <hi>They appointed the Chief Officers of State, as the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treaſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By which it appears, That from that time our Sovereign Lord <hi>Charles</hi> the Second hath not been King of <hi>England,</hi> but his Holineſs the Pope, and the Government his.</p>
            <p>Now this being granted (according to their Concluſion) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be guilty of thoſe Crimes laid to their Charge; <hi>viz.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second King of <hi>England,</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe there is no ſuch Perſon, The Pope being King.</item>
               <item>2. There being no ſuch Government, it being the Popes.</item>
            </list>
            <p>So that I think it is plainly made out the reaſon of their Denial of the Crimes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the firſt part of their Speeches; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they all concur and agree.</p>
            <p>And that notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Gavon</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, That there was not one Jeſuit except <hi>Mariana</hi> the Spaniſh Jeſuit, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of King-killing Doctrine; it is fully evidenced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Now as to the ſecond Part of their Speeches, which conſiſts of Proteſtations againſt all manner of Pardons, Abſolutions, or Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations for Lying, Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Aſſerting alſo, That no Power on Earth can Authorize any body ſo to do.</p>
            <p>It is true, It is very ſtrange to us that are Proteſtants, that there can be any Salvo for ſuch horrid Impieties, As the making of ſuch Solemn Proteſtations at the very Brink of Death, and in ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Terms too, That the Art of Man could never invent more, to make the matter more obvious to common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet all moſt notoriouſly falſe: as hath been ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, according to their Doctrines; which allow, That they may Swear, Forſwear, Lie, and Equivocate, in Defence of the Right, and for the Utility and Benefit of the Church: For which ſee the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where he tells you out of their own Authors, <hi>That the Pope can and does uſually diſpence with Oaths, and that he can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence againſt the Law of Nature, and againſt the Apoſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62432:2"/>
            <p>So that Papiſts may take as many Oaths as they pleaſe, yet the Pope (when he pleaſes) can diſpence with them, and ſet them free.</p>
            <p>And he ſays further, That if all theſe ways of Nulling the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Oaths fail, yet the Popes <hi>Janizaries</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> had a new way to prevent all ſuch Obligations of Oaths without any Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; and that is by Equivocations, Rectifying Intentions, and their Doctrine of Probabilities: Pernicious Errors, deſtructive of Humane Society: And (ſaith he) ſo notoriouſly known to the World, That he need not go about to prove them, or ſhew the pernicious Conſequences of them.</p>
            <p>They teach, That a Man may ſwear to Poſitive Untruths, by the Law of Directing the Intention.</p>
            <p>And therefore Father <hi>Southwell</hi> (a <hi>Jeſuit</hi>) taught a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, That if ſhe were examined, If the ſaid Mr. <hi>Southwell</hi> were at her Fathers Houſe? She might ſwear No, with this Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her ſelf, That he was not there, ſo that ſhe was bound to tell them.</p>
            <p>In time of the Plague a Man cometh to <hi>Coventry,</hi> at the Gates he is examined by the Officers upon his Oath, Whether he came from <hi>London,</hi> or no? The Traveller, though he came directly from <hi>London,</hi> may ſwear poſitively he did not come from <hi>London:</hi> The Reaſon is, Becauſe he knew himſelf not infected to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Coventry</hi> by his Entrance; which anſwereth the final Intent of the Demand.</p>
            <p>If you be ſworn to any thing contained in ſuch a Paper; you may ſafely ſwear to them (let them be never ſuch Untruths) and that you do believe all things written in the Paper to be true; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paper in your Boſome: where you muſt write what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſwear to.</p>
            <p>That Father <hi>Garnet</hi> (a great Maſter in this Faculty) upon his Arraignment being asked by the Court, Whether he did well, to ſwear upon the Holy <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> That he had neither writ or ſent to the <hi>Jeſuit Teſmond;</hi> which he knew to be falſe? He replied, That he ſwore ſo lawfully enough, becauſe he did not think that his Letters had been diſcovered; and ſo they could not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him.</p>
            <p>That the Uſe of Equivocation is held a good ſort of Prudence, and that they ought to be prized highly, who knew to make uſe of it rightly, and to ſerve themſelves of it. And <hi>Gregory de Valencia</hi> calls this Science a Prudent Defence, and doth much commend the Practice of it.</p>
            <p>See <hi>The Practical Divinity of the Papiſts, deſtructive to the Souls of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62432:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>As for Indulgences and Pardons for Lying, Swearing, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing and Equivocating; it is moſt certain they are granted by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> Nay for all manner of Sins: Of which take ſome few Inſtances.</p>
            <p>At St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> from the <hi>Aſcention Day</hi> to the Calends of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in every day Pardons for 14 years are granted.</p>
            <p>In St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in every day Pardons granted for 18 years.</p>
            <p>And ſo in divers other Churches for a certain number of years.</p>
            <p>And for a better proviſion for Sinners, when a leſs number of years are expired, the Holy <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> out of her tender regard toward Sinners, hath enlarged her bounty to Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years.</p>
            <p>As in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> is a Chappel called <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Sanctorum,</hi> not far from which is an Aſcent of 33 Steps; and if a Man ſhall aſcend them, for every Step he ſhall have 1000 years pardon; in all 33000 years.</p>
            <p>And ſo in divers other Churches for a great number of years.</p>
            <p>The Rates of all which Pardons are ſet down in the <hi>Taxa San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctae Cancellariae Apoſtolicae: Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Abſolution for Him who lieth with a Woman in the Church, and committed other Crimes, is rated at 6 Groſſo's. A Groſſo is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four pence farthing <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Prieſt keeps a Concubine, he muſt for his Abſolution pay 7 Groſſo's.</p>
            <p>And Abſolution for Perjury is but 6 Groſſo's.</p>
            <p>For all which ſee <hi>Jeſuits Catechiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Abundance of Variety of Examples are mentioned, of which I have only given you a Taſte, and recommend you to my Authors for a fuller ſatisfaction; where you will find all their Books quoted.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore conclude with this (which I intend only as a Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate) That, notwithſtanding all that ever theſe Gentlemen have ſaid with their laſt Breaths to the contrary (which indeed were enough to ſtartle and amaze any one that hath not known or heard any thing of their Principles) it is moſt evident, That the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does allow of Lying, Swearing, Forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Equivocating: And alſo that the ſaid Church does grant Pardons, Indulgences, and Abſolutions for the ſame.</p>
